## Discussion Board 1 Open Source Completed

**Reply:** After reading the introduction from "The Linux Command LIne" by William Shotts, I learned that Linux isn’t just a computer system, it represents a movement for freedom and control over our own technology. The author highlights how, in the past, computers were only for big corporations and governments, but now anyone can own one and even shape how it works. However, large tech companies have slowly taken back that control by deciding what we can and cannot do on our devices. Linux and open-source software fight against that by giving people the ability to truly understand and command their computers. I also learned that using the command line isn’t outdated or scary, it’s actually a powerful way to directly communicate with a computer. Unlike the graphical interface, which makes simple tasks easy, the command line allows users to handle complex operations efficiently. Overall, this showed me that Linux is more than a tool, it’s about personal empowerment and digital freedom.
