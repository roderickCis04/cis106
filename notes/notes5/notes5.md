## Commands to navigate the file system

### **LS COMMAND (ls) ** 

The LS command is used for listing the content of a given directory of the file/directory itself. It has a lot of characteristics:

- ls can be used with or without arguments.
- Using ls without a file or directory lists the content of the present working directory.
- ls has a lot of options. Which can be seen with man ls

###  *Formula*: 

- ls + option + directory to list
